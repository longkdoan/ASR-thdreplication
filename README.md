We use Stata 17 for the analyses. The dataset provided here includes merged in qualitative coding we did on the open-ended responses. The raw data without these codes and data cleaning we did will be available from the TESS website in SPSS format. The included do-files contain instructions on cleaning the original dataset once it is converted to Stata format.

This is a do-file for the main analyses presented in the paper. It requires the following user-written commands. Use the ```findit``` command to download these user-written packages:
- ```esttab```
- ```spost13```
- ```coefplot```

[Online supplement](https://www.example.com)

This is a do-file for the online supplement for the paper. It requires the following user-written commands. Use the ```findit``` command to download these user-written packages:
- ```esttab```
- ```spost13```

We use the graphic scheme ```cleanplots``` by [Trent Mize](https://www.trentonmize.com/software/cleanplots). It's not required to run the do-files, but the graphs will look better than the default graphing scheme.
